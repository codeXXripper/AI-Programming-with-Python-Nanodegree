Answer: Resnet model architecture did better than the rest. This model algorithm correcty classified the uploaded images of dogs and not dogs labels perfectly . And it took the time it needed not so fast also not too slow which is 0:0:5 compare to alenet 0:0:2 and vgg 0:0:12.So based on it's accurate result and the the time it tooks to return these results I choose the resnet model architecture.
